 bsdcert
=========

small shell script to run on machines instead of using section A.2 of the
thesis to do certificate management. sets everything up completely
automatically and also configures a cron job so you never have to worry about
this again.

requirements:
- have completed section A.1
- have your stupid port 80 open
